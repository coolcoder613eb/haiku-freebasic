fbdoc TODO list
---------------

[ ]	add proxy support to CHttp.

[ ] add an image getter using libCURL so the on-line images
	can be included in the CHM version of the docs.
	[ ] built-in support for image getting ( uses external tool currently )
	[ ] only include images in the HTML tarball that are actually referenced
	    by the doc pages
	[X] add support to CWakka2Html for images

[ ]	remove preservation of the TAB + "~" indentation.  only TAB is needed.
	- The "~" characters are preserved for now to allow easy testing of
	  recently added CWiki->Build() method.

[ ] improve format of keywords.lst so that it could be used as an input file
	to generate other files for editors that support syntax highlighting.

[ ] Code clean-up
	[ ] refactor common code in CWakka2Html and CWakka2fbhelp
	[ ] refactor common code in CWiki2Chm, CWiki2Txt, and CWiki2fbhelp
	[ ] combine mkfbhelpfile.bas with CWiki2Txt and don't write out 100's of
		files during the build

[ ] Distribution
	[ ] add makefiles, scripts, a batchfile, ( anything ) to build all docs
	    from scratch and zip/gzip all files needed for distribution.

[ ] Documentation
	[ ] create documentation for fbdoc command line options
	[ ] create an overview of how fbdoc works
	[ ] create documentation for fbdoc library ( the library might change so
		this can't be overly complicated to maintain )
	[ ] create a CHM possibly using just the FBWiki* pages from the on-line
		docuentation

[ ] New emitters
	[ ] write the Texinfo emitter
	[ ] write the PDF emitter ( may require an intermediate format, or based
		on Texinfo output files )

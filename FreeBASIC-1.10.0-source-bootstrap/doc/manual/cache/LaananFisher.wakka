	I regularly use and recommend ""FreeBASIC"" to anyone needing a language that provides ease-of-use, low development times, portability and support for a variety of programming paradigms. I log on occasionally at the official ""FreeBASIC"" site [[[www.freebasic.net]]] and read about what's new with ""FreeBASIC"" and its great community at the forums there [[[www.freebasic.net/forum]]].

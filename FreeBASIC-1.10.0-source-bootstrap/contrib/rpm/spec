%description
The FreeBASIC project is a set of cross-platform development tools initially
created by Andre Victor, consisting of a compiler, GNU-based assembler,
linker and archiver, and supporting runtime libraries, including a
software-based graphics library. The compiler, fbc, currently supports
building for i386-based architectures on the DOS, Linux, Windows and Xbox
platforms. The project also contains thin bindings (header files) to some
popular 3rd party libraries such as the C runtime library, Allegro, SDL,
OpenGL, GTK, the Windows API and many others, as well as example programs
for many of these libraries.

FreeBASIC is a high-level programming language supporting procedural,
object-oriented and meta-programming paradigms, with a syntax compatible to
Microsoft QuickBasic. In fact, the FreeBASIC project originally began as an
attempt to create a code-compatible, free alternative to Microsoft QuickBasic,
but it has since grown into a powerful development tool. FreeBASIC can be seen
to extend the capabilities of Microsoft QuickBasic in a number of ways,
supporting more data types, language constructs, programming styles, and
modern platforms and APIs.
